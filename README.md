# Persona 5 Royal Guide
Live site visible at: http://persona5royal.netlify.app/

This site is a hub for Persona 5 Royal guides and resources. When I was playing this game with a guide, I noticed that all the websites were overloaded with ads or refreshed every time I opened the page up on my phone. The overall layout and typography were also poorly designed, so I felt like I was struggling a little too much to just grab the little snippets of information I needed.

## Project Goal
- Familiarize myself with Gatsby
    - And consequently, Gatby's spin on React
- Familiarize myself with Markdown
  - Familiarize myself with GraphQL
- Generate unique pages and routing based off Markdown files

## Upcoming
- Implement a component that shows which arcana will be needed for the next seven days
- Make the guide contents a bit more "my own"
    - Break up each day to alleviate all the "All Day - Auto" pages
    - General changes I found while playing
- Add resources for social links
- Add resource for darts
- Update layout to be less plain
